📘 Flask CI/CD Pipeline – Exact Project Notes
🔹 Project Name

Flask CI/CD using Jenkins, GitHub, Docker & Docker Hub

🔹 Objective
To build a complete CI/CD pipeline that:

Pulls code from GitHub

Builds a Docker image for a Flask app

Runs automated tests

Pushes the image to Docker Hub

Prepares the app for deployment

🔹 Tools & Technologies Used

Git & GitHub – Source code management

Jenkins – CI/CD automation

Docker – Containerization

Docker Hub – Image registry

Flask – Python web framework

Pytest – Automated testing

Ubuntu (EC2) – Jenkins server

🔹 Project Architecture
GitHub → Jenkins → Docker Build → Test → Docker Hub

🔹 Step-by-Step What We Did
1️⃣ Created Flask Application

Developed a simple Flask app

Added unit tests using pytest

Application runs on port 5000

2️⃣ Dockerized the Flask App

Created a Dockerfile:

Base image: python:3.9-alpine

Installed dependencies

Copied application code

Exposed Flask app using container port 5000

3️⃣ Pushed Code to GitHub

Repository: Dev-project-1

Branch: master

Stored:

Flask app

Tests

Dockerfile

Jenkinsfile

4️⃣ Installed & Configured Jenkins

Jenkins installed on Ubuntu EC2

Required plugins installed:

Git

Pipeline

Credentials Binding

Jenkins job created using Pipeline from SCM

5️⃣ Configured Jenkins Credentials
🔐 GitHub Credentials

Used HTTPS authentication

Jenkins used stored GitHub credentials for SCM checkout

🔐 Docker Hub Credentials

Created Docker Hub Personal Access Token (PAT)

Added in Jenkins as:

Type: Username & Password

Credential ID: dockerhub-creds

Username: meera786

Password: Docker Hub PAT

6️⃣ Created Jenkins Pipeline (Jenkinsfile)

pipeline: sourcecode+dockerfile--dockerimage--tetimg--deploy to dockerhub

🧱 Build Stage

Built Docker image:

docker build -t my-flask-app .


Tagged image:

docker tag my-flask-app meera786/my-flask-app:latest

🧪 Test Stage

Ran containerized tests:

docker run my-flask-app python -m pytest app/tests/


All tests passed successfully

🚀 Deploy (Push) Stage

Logged in to Docker Hub using Jenkins credentials

Pushed image to Docker Hub:

docker push meera786/my-flask-app:latest

🧹 Post Actions

Logged out from Docker Hub for security

7️⃣ Fixed Major Issues During Pipeline

✔ GitHub authentication (PAT vs password)
✔ Jenkins credentials ID mismatch
✔ Docker Hub authentication failure
✔ Merge conflicts in Jenkinsfile
✔ Docker login using PAT instead of password

8️⃣ Final Successful Pipeline Result

✔ Jenkins job ran successfully
✔ Docker image built
✔ Tests passed
✔ Image pushed to Docker Hub
✔ Pipeline status: SUCCESS

🔹 Docker Hub Output

Repository: meera786/my-flask-app

Tag: latest

Image pushed successfully

🔹 How to Access the Flask App

After deployment:

docker run -d -p 5000:5000 meera786/my-flask-app:latest


Access via browser:

http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:5000

🔹 Key DevOps Concepts Covered

CI/CD pipeline design

Jenkins declarative pipeline

Secure credential management

Docker containerization

Automated testing

Artifact versioning

Image registry usage

🔹 Resume-Ready Description

Built a complete CI/CD pipeline using Jenkins that automates Docker image build, testing, and publishing of a Flask application to Docker Hub using secure credentials and personal access tokens.

🔹 Interview One-Line Summary

Implemented an end-to-end Jenkins CI/CD pipeline for a Dockerized Flask application with automated testing and Docker Hub deployment.
